## Call for papers
According to this [site](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=robotics), there are quite a lot of options to submit conference papers. What criteria to decide which conference to submit to?

## Conferences from System Engineering Laboratory
**Tobias**
- International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Mechatronics (ICARM)
- International Electronics Symposium (IES)

There are too many options so it is better to consider related topics such as Robotics.
