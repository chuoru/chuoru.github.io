## Journal ranking
To begin to write draft for journal paper, I planned to search more information to know more about this area of expertise. 
According to this site [https://www.resurchify.com/](https://www.resurchify.com/), academic community measures or compares journals based on their impact score. Also, it is uncertain that paid journal is less impact than free journal; however, one of senior researchers in our lab mentioned that free journal is better for evaluation of the research. 

To the main discussion, consider this ranking from [ooir.org](https://ooir.org/journals.php?field=Computer+Science&category=Robotics&metric=jif#) using impact factor as measurement.
